# Surf's Up!
We're setting up a Surf n' Shake Shop with a new invester--W. Avy. We're meeting with him to discuss how we can get our shop to Oahu. Analyzing some data sets are the first step to knowing what we can present to W. Avy.

### Precipitation Data
We know that it rains in Oahu, but we don't konw exactly when. To predict that, we look at previous data and retrieve precipitation data.
From the reseults we got, we can see, from the graph that...
- Some months have higher amounts of precipitation than others
- The levels of rain vary over the years, and there's no specific trend for months that have the most rain in a year
- There are, however, more peaks every 3 months in 2017.

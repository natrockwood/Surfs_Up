# Surf's Up!
We're setting up a Surf n' Shake Shop with a new invester--W. Avy. We're meeting with him to discuss how we can get our shop to Oahu. Analyzing some data sets are the first step to knowing what we can present to W. Avy.

### Precipitation Data
We know that it rains in Oahu, but we don't konw exactly when. To predict that, we look at previous data and retrieve precipitation data.
